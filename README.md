Welcome to the GitHub repository for my project on predicting the winner of NFL games using machine learning techniques. This project, undertaken in July 2023, aims to predict the winner of an NFL game using Logistic Regression, SVM, and Decision Trees with features obtained from in-game statistics as well as external rating systems.

## Project Breakdown

My project is broken down into four main parts:

1. **Data Collection part 1**: Collecting sample data from the 2022 season
2. **Data Collection part 2**: Collecting NFL season data from 1970-2022 and performing basic modeling
3. **Feature Improvement and Model Testing**: Feature optimization and ensemble learning application
4. **Final Modeling and Practical Application**: Final optimization and use case example
